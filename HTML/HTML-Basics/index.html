    <h2 textAlign="center">There’s more to painting than simply applying pigment to canvas.</h2>
    <p>Mixing colors is just as important as the technique or style of your work.
        Choosing the right hues can make a huge impact in conveying the emotion of a painting; it goes hand-in-hand with
        the subject matter.
        Consider, for instance, Picasso’s paintings from his Blue Period. Would they have been as poignant without the
        use of blue tones?

    <p>It’s important to learn how to mix colors when you first begin your painting practice. In doing so, your work
        will have rich, multifaceted hues that are truly an expression of yourself and your subject. Many of us have the
        urge to just use colors from the paint tube, but those hues can be oversaturated, flat, or just plain unnatural
        looking. Knowing how to craft your colors will produce prettier hues—plus, you'll save a lot of money in <a

        because you're not having to buy every tube of paint in the color you want to use.
